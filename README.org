* Introduction

This project is an attempt to reproduce some Lissajous curves drawn by an
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph][harmonograph]].

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve][Lissajous curves]] are drawings of parametric equations which are intimately
related to harmony, and therefore with music or even planetary patterns, given
proper perspective. The following drawing depicts a screenshot of the finished
application.

The decision to build this small experiment came from a friend of mine, as she
showed me a certain GIF animation with certain parametric behaviour. As soon as
I saw the animation, having recently read [[https://www.amazon.com/Quadrivium-Classical-Liberal-Geometry-Cosmology/dp/0802778135][Quadrivium]], I immediately spotted the
resemblance to Lissajous curves, which encouraged me to build a simulation of
many harmonographs running under certain intervals.

This application was built in Common Lisp, and uses OpenGL and GLFW3 for
rendering and context/window creation.

Below is the GIF animation my friend showed me, which inspired this project.

* Installation and Usage

Make sure you have [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]] installed. Clone, copy this repository, or create a
symlink on your ~local-projects~ directory. Then, load the system and run the
application:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :harmonograph)
(harmonograph:run-app)
#+end_src

Close the window or press ~ESC~ anytime to quit the application.

** Note on performance and requirements

This application was designed to run using OpenGL 2.x, with fixed
pipeline. Trailing effect was created using the accumulation buffer, which
impacts performance. This should not be a problem when running such a simple
application, but it may cause problems on higher resolutions.
